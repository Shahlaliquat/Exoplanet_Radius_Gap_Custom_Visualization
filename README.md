# Exoplanet Radius Gap – Interactive D3.js Chart
This project is a simple interactive visualization of the Exoplanet Radius Gap using D3.js.
It shows how planets are distributed by their radius and orbital period, with interactive zooming, tooltips, and filters so you can explore the data easily.
## What's Inside
index.html – The main web page with the D3.js code to display the chart.

points.json – The dataset containing planet radius and orbital period information.

data_prep.py – Python script used to prepare the dataset before loading it into the visualization.
## How to Run
Download or Clone this repository to your computer.

Open the project folder in VS Code (or any editor).

Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.

Right-click on index.html → "Open with Live Server".

Your browser will open, showing the interactive chart.
## Features
Pure Contour Density Plot – See how planets are distributed in a smooth contour map.

Zoom & Pan – Move around and zoom into areas of interest.

Tooltips – Hover over points to see planet details.

Filter – Show only the planets you want to explore.
## Why This Project Exists
Scientists have discovered that there’s a "gap" in the sizes of small exoplanets 
this visualization helps show that gap in an easy, interactive way for both researchers and curious people.
## Requirements
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Internet connection (for D3.js CDN).

Optional: Python (only if you want to run data_prep.py to update the dataset).
